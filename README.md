# Data Training 2020 in Vlachos Group

### Authors

### Proposed Outline of Data Science Training Sessions:

Introductory Session
- Provide an overview of flowchart and methods on it
- Get group members set up with local Python environment to be used for the rest of the trainings and their own analysis afterwards
- Visualize data structures: scatter plot, histograms, covariance matrices

Explore data 1:
- Outlier detection: Isolation forests, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
- Cluster visualization: k-means, GMM

Explore data 2:
- Explore dimensionality: PCA + varimax

Data Driven Modeling 1:
- Data processing concepts: standardization, train/test/validate splitting, target metrics, regularization
- Empirical models and their strengths and dangers (overfitting)

Data Driven Modeling 2:
- Categorical model construction: random forest, logistic regression

Data Driven Modeling 3:
- Continuous model construction: OLS, PLS, LASSO, PCR, elastic net, random forest
- All these concepts are fairly similar in theory and implementation, so it is feasible to cover them all in a single session

Model Usage 1:
- Model comparison and obtaining predictions
- Model optimization: BO

Final Session: We would hold one more session to review the flowchart and answer specific questions our group has for their problems to encourage implementation.
